Project proposals are due Sunday night

2 weeks from now is the first major stage

We'll talk about layout stuff today

Flexbox is probably the most complex thing we'll discuss today

Have you done your reading for today (chapter 7)

It's better to read beforehand, but still make sure to read the text

---
What concepts from chapter 7 should we go over (or other questions)

Flexbox, flex containers in a flex container
flex shrink, flex grow
floating - away to move something to the side. we don't use it all that often.
it's not really very good for doing columns, or complicated layout

inline block

---
Which of the following are true about 'inline elements?

TRUE - They are positioned horizontally next to each other by default 

FALSE They are positioned vertically 
- these are block elements - 

FALSE - 'div' elements are an example of an 'inline' element
- div elements are block elements
- span are inline

FALSE - You can specify their width and height properties via CSS
- if you have an inline element, you can't specify width and height. if you try and add a width property it won't work.
- if you want it to be inline and you wnat to specify, then you use "inline-block" property

See the stylesample.css example for #element - NOTE that if you hover over the width property in visual code it will say it
won't be applied
This is the reason inline-block was created. 

The place this is used most of the time is if you are in a situation doing a nav bar.

Show the example in the demo 

There are a ton of ways to do nav bars. This is a quick way to format a nav bar. 

FALSE - They can contain 'block' elements inside of them
- you can't put a block element inside of an inline. YOu can, but it's malformed. It probably won't look the way expect
-block elements can contain block and inline elements
-inline elements shouldn't contain block elements


TRUE - They can be made into block elements w/in CSS
- yes, using inline-block. You do this using the display property
- display: "block", "inline", or "inline-block", "none" to switch the property

----
In the below diagram of the box model, which CSS property corresponds to each section?

- 5 is correct - a content, b padding, c border, d margin

padding is a good default to alter if you are trying to keep two elements apart
margin is the more useful if you have a border and if you want to keep the borders apart (if there is a border)

margins collapse, so if you have side by-side-elements the browser will collapse and use the larger of the two margins

padding is contained completely within the element, so if both elements say they need space, that is honored by the browser
and not collapsed.

----


Which of the below CSS rules is equivalent to the first? 
This one is harder

The correct answer is D. The first number is top and bottom, second number is left and right

The reason for this question, you can declare alot of properties using shortcut properties
You can enumerate all 4 for padding,
But writing out 4 rules when they are the same, there is likely a 

padding: 0
set's all to 0

padding 0 .4em; left/right and top/bottom

Borders have lots of options as well with this.

Border: 1px solid black;

border-bottom-width: 5px;
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border 
You can play around with this. the order should be "width, style, color", but it seems to work in other orders

if you don't specify the values, you'll get the default or whatever is inherited from the element.

------

To make an element fixed to the bottom of the window, which of the following properties would you need to specify? 
(Select all that apply)

position: fixed
bottom: 0

This is probably the most common.

You don't make it "absolute". If you make it both fixed and absolute, the absolute will override and make it absolute if its
done after in the css file. 

You've moved it from the normal flow, so you need to specify where it goes.

Demo: Flexbox

The idea of flexbox is a newish CSS standard. CSS 3 divides some things into groups that can be used together 
The goal of flexbox is to solve the problem of having multiple columns on a page

People used to try and use a crazy number of floats in weird ways.

Flexbox is designed to help with that

First let's walk through some things with Flexbox:
----------------------

SLIDE 9
Box Sizing rule

An elements padding, border and margin can be used to put space between elements on a page

However - when you assign an explicit width or height to an element the dimension doesn't include the padding or border when
calculating the size of the element of the page.

This can get confusing when working with complex layouts (like flexbox) 

You can do this with the "box-sizing: border-box;" property.

You typically would apply to all elements on the page, thus the * {} . 

You might want to do this across all css files.

Best practice is just to use border-box for box-sizing.

---------------------

Flexbox 2 elements

To use a Flexbox layout you need to style two different class elements
1 )  container (parent) - which acts as a container for the 
2 )  item (child) - child elements are nested inside the container 

The name of the container in the example is : "flex-container". It's not required to be called that. 
What's important is that the display is "flex". However, kind of cool to be semantically accurate using "flex-container"?
In our demo, the container is ".boxes"

flex-grow: specifies which "share" or ratio of any extra space in the container the item should take
Example if a container is 500px and the items take 400px, this determines where the extra 100px is given to each item

flex-shrink: works similarly but in reverse. So if the container space is smaller than the size required by the items
then this determines what share or ratio the item should shrink to accommodate overflow.
In general we keep this at default, except if you want to make sure that one item does not shrink by giving flex-shrink: 0;


flex-basis: allows you to specify initial dimensions of a particular item
Using % lets you easily size columns for layout
----------------------------------

SLIDE 11
Flexbox Base example

Here we have the basic components to demonstrate flexbox

The html has a section of class .boxes

We've made the .boxes class to be a flexbox container by adding "display: flex;"

Notice the background colors show what's the container and what's the items

--------------------------
SLIDE 12
Flexbox: Flex-grow

Flexgrow does the math to fill extra space in container when the size of the items doesn't fill it.

------------------------

SLIDE 13
Flexbox: Flex-grow (2)

Add a class to the top div item and make give it 3 (rather than 1)

See what it does

Flexbox properties

Here's how the calculation is done when you use integers

One more thing: Inline block

As we discussed in the poll questions, an unordered list is a pretty good way to 
represent nav items. If we want to format these horizontally across the page
and format the boxes around them, using inline-block is a good way
