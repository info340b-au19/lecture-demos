Slide 2
Project Topics
Set of topics to work on

Hoping that this will help get people to work on things that are similar for later in the quarter

You are not required to work on one of these. You won't lose points at all
But realize you might lose some of your work as we progress.

Slide 3
Updating Problem Sets

Once in a while there are errors in the problem sets
We find bugs once in a while. Likely will have to be updated.
If we need to fix bugs in the test suites. Then you need to upload

We can't push to your indivdual repos. You need to pull it on your own. we will push the fixes the the main repo
You will need to add another remote link to your repo (bookmark). 

you don't have to name this reference link "upstream"

I might need to give you the link to the repo because we use the same started code as sectionA 
for example on problem 2 it's : info340a-wi19/problem-02-starter

"git remote -v " will show you the remotes (bookmarks) you have attached to your repo

git pull upstream master

So now you can pull from origin, or from the other bookmark

So you can pull

Have you don't the reading (through chapter 6) for today

This is totally anonymous - Just want to see if people are doing the reading.
You'll do better if you keep up with the reading. Fortunately it isn't a large amount of reading


What concepts should we go over from chapter 6 (or other questions)

Psuedo Selectors
CSS for specific browsers
- in general we try and use css that is supported by all browsers. sometimes there are some new cutting edge
features that show up. we try to not to use them
Attribute Selectors


Which selector syntax would you use to style elements with class 'alert' OR with class 'success'?

The answer is C

the comma acts like an OR in CSS

if you have the <space> that says "children"... the descendent selector

like this:
<div class="alert>
	<div class="success"> </div>
</div>


if we don't have a space at all, that's the case where the element has both properties.
It has the class alert and success

like this:
<div class="alert success"> </div>

Demo how Visual Code will show you the html structure of a css selector

To do this, have this in your css file:

.success .alert {
 	color: yellow
	}
Then hover over the selector
-----------------------

Which rule(s) will apply to links inside an element with class 'highlight', which is inside of a 'nav' element?

The answer is A and D

B and C are out

Find any nav element, find any highlight element and then find any anchor elements inside of that

The diff between A and D means that the > requires that the children are direct decendents
 
So A and D are correct.

CSS Diner game is linked in the text to practice

-------
Which CSS rule will correctly style the HTML?

When we say it has both classes, the element has to have both.

So <div class="first second">

A does not have that. It's inside an element that has class="first", but that's not the same. 
The element itself literally needs to have both classes.

B this will make all the paragraphs green because they all are direct descendents of divs

C .second, #first
gets the first one right because within the class the
the #first is an id, there is nothing with an id of "first"

and the bottom one has a div that is of class "second" so it doesn't apply to that

C is the right answer

Only be as specific as we need to be

Start with as general as possible

d: p:last-child
It applies to both of the paragraphs (even the second)

Psuedo Classes
CSS supports a bunch of pseudo classes. 
You are able to select something based on the context of the page or how other things will be rendered. 

Index of standard pseudo=classes: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes

The way we write the pseudo selector:

p:last-child 
p:first-child
P:nth-child()

p:nth-child(2) {
	color: yellow
	}

This would find paragraphs that are the 2nd child of a parent element

<div>
	<p> paragraph one </p>
	<p> paragraph two </p>  <-- this one
	<p> paragraph three </p>
</div>

Note that it's not the second paragraph, but the second child of a parent element

<div>
	<div class="success">
		<p> paragraph one </p>   <--this one
		<div>
			<p> paragraph two </p>  
			<p> paragraph three </p>    <-- this one
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

"of type" specifies that it's of a particular type


The most common selector you will see is the hover

a:hover {
	font-size: 3em;
	color: orange;
	font-weight: 900;
}

applies a style whenever the mouse hovers over it

em - relative size

hover is almost always combined with the "focus" class

If I hit <tab> through the elements
so if the focus moves you can do the same as hover

Screen readers use tabbing around


so

a:hover, a:focus {             <--- hover or focus
	font-size: 3em;
	color: orange;
	font-weight: 900;
}

a:visited {
	color: green;
}

Consider organizing your css file based on the layout of your page

/*Header*/

/*Main Section*/

/*Footer*/

The linter will probably warn you if you have more specific rules before less specific rules

got back to minute 54 in video

classes are more specific... more precise. it win's over generic things even if it's earier on the page
