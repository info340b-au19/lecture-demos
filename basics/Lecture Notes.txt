Here's what we are going to do today

If you've done of this stuff before it'll be somewhat review
But lots of folks haven't in Here

Wake up your iMac
I will share the screen pretty much every class session.

Remind me to share if I forget. thx

In theory this is being recorded. Sometimes it doesn't work. Sometimes the volume gets screwed up.

Slide 5 and 6:
--------------
This is who I am

Slide 7 and 8
--------------
Who are you?
Turn around and spend a couple minutes finding out about the person next to you and behind you...

Has everyone made a new file?

Very collaborative class, especially in the 2nd half of the class.

Other students in the class are some of the best resources.

Anyone want to share something that they are worried about?

Slide 9

Fun facts about Us

Slide 10
--------------
Course Resources - Canvas

Canvas is the main source for information

My contact info at the top

Elisa is your TA. She is a great source of help.

It's a difficult class. It's a great class. Use Elisa me, your classmates, google as sources of information and help.

Walk through a few things on the site... Show them what isn't "cooked yet". Like some of the assignments

Slide 11
--------------
Flipped Class 
You are doing much of your learning at home. In class we are reviewing, giving you examples, reinforcing
At home you should be keeping ahead of the reading before lecture.

You will have time to to some work in many lectures during the 2nd half of the class. 
In that way it is somewhat self pacing. But we move so fast that really you will want to keep on top of things.
You will have access to other students and the instuctors in class.

The flip side of this means you have to be self motivated. I won't give you all the answers to everything.

You guys are capable of doing this. You are all UW students in the ischool.

Typically we spend 1/2 of the class doing the lecture
Then we spend the 2nd half of the class doing exercises and projects

Slide 12
--------------
Course Resources
The course book is here. It's really pretty good and the exercises, lectures and projects follow very closely.
You will do well to stay up to date with this. It's not alot of reading.

Notice it's a spider web (get it?)

We generally do about a chapter a day, but we start off with more content.

Slide 13
--------------
There are 2 main types of assignments
Problem sets - definitely follow the readings

These probably take about 3 to 4 hours a week. You'll have some time in class
But you'll also likely have work to do outside of class

We aren't super strict on due dates for problems sets, but you don't want to fall behind.

In addition we have projects
Pick something that you are excited about and want to work on.

You can use it as a portfolio piece

You can change over time, but it's better to be able to build on your previous work.

Go to the page on Canvas (link on slide)

Walk through the stages

We can adjust as time goes. We've done it once.

On lab on Thursday we'll do some brainstorming. And you will be encouraged to pick one of the topics
But you can pick something else. It just is easier to combine if you pick things that are 
somewhat related.

These are due about every other week through the quarter.

Slide 14
--------------
The time expectations is pretty heavy. Be prepared. The average amount of time per week has been about 18 hours even through
typical 5 credit classes here take about 15 hours. 

Slide 15 
--------------
Course Resources

Slack is the best way to ask. And don't just ask Ian or Me. You can do that, but you should also propose to the #general 
channel


The goal is for you to learn. Use the methods that help you.

Get help where-ever you need to. You have lots of resources

Slide 16
--------------
We access by what you turn in. So do your own work.

Don't split up the problem sets.

Don't just copy code from others

Collaboration. You can talk to other people about your work. Don't turn in work that you found on the net.
If you use something from the net give credit for what you did.

If you are working on an individual assignment. Don't have someone else fix it for you.

Slide 17
--------------
Client-side Web Development

We are doing work on the "Client side"

On your own machine. Not the stuff happening on the web server

Which of these two computers are we interested in working with? 

Slide 18 and 19
--------------
Using the Internet
When you go view a web page, what your computer does is to send an http request to a server asking for a web page

That server then sends back a response 

Your browser takes those files, combines it with the browser processing and figures out how to render them

And turns them into the web page

So what we are doing in this class is writing the source code for those files that the server provides to the Client

Slide 21
--------------
Clone the starter code (for the demo)

So this week might not be that important to clone the git repo of the demo we'll be doing in class
You can instead just create the couple of files if you want. Or follow along

If you look on the Canvas site you'll see a link to the "code on github" (show them)
And if you look for the "lecture-demos" repo, you'll see the stuff I worked on in 
class there. I check it in after each session.

As the quarter goes on, there will be good examples there for you to refer back to.

You can try and work around with me in lecture. 

I think you all have had experience with git and github

Slide 22
--------------
Visual Studio is really pretty good. It's free open source from Microsoft
You can use another IDE, but if you don't already have one you use,
this is a good one.

command space, type "visual studio" and run it

It's a lightweight editor. 

Let's make a file called "index.html". this is the default file that a web page will serve if able
request is made

You will usually have at least 3 files open (html, css, jscript)

If you drag the folder down to VS you automatically get these files opened in a tab each.


Slide 23
--------------
So we have an index.html file with a sentence

Slide 24
--------------
if you file/open in the finder and select chrome to open the file

You'll see that we have a page!

That's the idea, we add some source code to a file

Notice that line breaks are ignored so there was some interpretation being done by the browser

Slide 25
--------------
What if we want to say How the content is rendered?

Slide 26
--------------
html

A programing language

Annotating Text to give semantic meaning to the Text

It's not just a salad of words, they are structured in some way

It's designed to allow documents to link to each other

Slide 27
--------------
HTML Syntax

basic syntax - we surround content with tags

a tag has < and > with </ > as the ending syntax
There are a bunch of different kinds of tags.

Slide 28
--------------
Common tags

h1, h2, p, a (anchor or hyperlink), img... expectations


Slide 29
--------------
Practice

add tags around the two lines for paragraph

Add a top level heading <h1> as well
<h1> Hello HTML </h1>

Go back to the list of tags Walk through the items

<h1>Hello HTML</h1>
<p>write a sentence that says some stuff</p>

<p>its way to early!</p>

<em>look at me!</em>

This is half of html

Slide 30
--------------
The second piece to HTML of syntax is that these elements (the tag and it's content) is that
these elements can contain attributes

Giving further information to the elements

These are basically variables. So the variable name followed by an '=' followed by the value
strings have " " around them (quotes)

Slide 31
--------------
So for example if we want have content that is a link to the ischool homepage

<a href="https://ischool.uw.edu">Link to the ischool</a>

The href is the variable, and the URL is the value

To do an image:
<!-- an image -->
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Husky_on_San_Francisco_sidewalk.jpg/220px-Husky_on_San_Francisco_sidewalk.jpg" alt="a husky puppy">

We always want to have an alt attributes
This gives alternate text instead of the image

Images have no actual textual content. So we don't need to include the end tag.

refresh the page and it's there!

Attributes seem okay?

you'll need to know which attributes that go with which tags

href goes with anchor

src goes with image

Slide 32
--------------
Nesting elements
The piece that makes it awesome and complicated. Its possible to nest these elements

So a header can have other tags within 

<h1>Hello <em>(with emphasis)</em> world!</h1>

Notice that alot of these items are on the same line

This is because these are inline tags

You can embed <p>'s around to force line breaks

Elements that contain elements, that contain elements

Slide 33
--------------
What's wrong here?

What's the problem with this set of html?
<p>I <strong>never<strong> make mistakes</p>
Didn't close the tag

paste it in and you can see what happens

Slide 34
--------------
Nesting Elements: Lists

Slide 35
--------------
<ul>
  <li>Pigeons</li>
  <li>
    Swallows:
    <ol>
      <li>African</li>
      <li>European</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Budgies</li>
</ul>



Slide 36
--------------
Visual studio gives some shortcuts for keeping code indented correctly

Bringing up the command pallette

command shift p on mac, f1 on pc
"format code" will automatically fix up your tabbing

if you cmd / you will comment things automatically
on pc cntrl / you comment things automatically

slide 37
--------------
HTML for the Web

Everything we write should be within an HTML elements (closing tag at bottom of page)

within the html we have a body tag
The body is the stuff we see




Slide 38
--------------
All pages are represented by a tree of elements


Slide 39
--------------
HTML for the Web

We include the "!DOCTYPE html" , which is actually XML

It's a declaration to say what kind of content is in this documents

The <head>
includes meta data 
Infomration about the web page that doesn't show up on the page

The <title> shows up on the tab of chrome

meta charset - unicode character set. So the browser knows how to interpret unique characters

author 

Basically every web page you write will have this core set of hierarchy

Slide 40
--------------
NPM

Tooling app store for managing packages

comes with node js 

you run a command telling it to install software

"npm install"

We install some things globally (for my entire computer)
or locally

if you want to install and record

Slide 41
--------------
Live-Server
For example we can install "live server"

sudo npm install -g live-server

if you get permission denied, you need to use sudo (switch to admin mode and run the command)

So now we install 'live-server'

Now run live server from that directory

If start modifying stuff and save the files, when it gets saved, the page automatically refreshes

It's running a little web server

You might want to run this from another terminal because live server eats up the session

Slide 42
--------------
Testing our code

Jest

install globally first
install dependencies that are added next

then run the tests 


Each problem set has a file called "package.json"
This is where all the dependencies are stored

Npm updates this file when it's installed first
Then we run npm install with no other arguments and it looks in the package.json and it
will install all the things listed that are dependencies

the starter code has a file called "demo.spec.js" which is a jest test you can pass as arguments

Slide 43
--------------
Travis Class

Automatially runs the Jest Tests for you on the class github repos 

You can test your stuff locally and work to pass before checking in.

Slide 44 - Slide 46
--------------
Make the web pages look better

Slide 47
--------------
css
Cascading Style Sheets


SLIDE 48
--------------
CSS Syntax
It has it's own weird syntax

There are a set of rules

There are two pieces

rules lists what values to assignment
don't forget the semicolons

selectors tell which elements the properties apply to

SLIDE 49
--------------

SLIDE 50
--------------
font-family
font-size
padding
...etc 


We create a new file as a .css file
style.css is a good name

paste our rules

h1 {
  font-family: 'Helvetica';
  color: white;
  background-color: #333; /*dark gray*/
}

p {
   font-size: 14pt;
   font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;
}

<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="my-style.css">
</head>


Slide 52
--------------
Why two languages?

Because we wnat to separate content from appearance

concerns are separated so they don't get muddied together

Slide 54
--------------
HTML is not used for appearence

This is why we use "em" instead of "i" it doesn't mean anything.
We want to use that have symantic meaning. The CSS can determine how that looks

never use i or b tags

Slide 55
--------------
Class selectors

if we want to apply to a single paragraph, we can use a "class" selectors
give the paragraph a name 
<p class="highlighted">This text is highlighted!</p>

then do this in CSS to select
/* CSS */
.highlighted { 
  background-color: yellow;
}

Cascading is because they cascade... 

last one on the page wins
