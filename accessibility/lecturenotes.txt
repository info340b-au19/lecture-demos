How is it going?
Issues getting npm, jest, live-server installed?

Assignment 1 and 2 are there
I'll get Assignment 3 available soon.

Slide 2
Overall plan today

Slide 3
Course Project

Slide 4
Project Ideas

Slide 5:
Project Stages

Stage 2 is the biggest one
You can use mock data

Around 35 minutes into class

Slide 6:
In order to help facilitate interaction with you guys
We use Poll Everywhere

Has anyone not used Poll Everywhere

You can use your phone, computer, whatever

You should be able to go to pollev.com/login you should be able to login with your uw email

if you go to pollev.com/timca you will see the polls that are active

Take a minute to login please


What is one question about material or about the course so far?
-----------
if you don' thave a question you can say "nope"


Why don't we have a final?  It's a skills based test. Nothing to memorize. This is how real web development works

Do we always have to use Jest for problem sets? Yes. 

Will our homework be as detailed going forward? Yes they are detailed.

We use GitHub because it's free and easy. But you can upload to any webhosting service that you want
It doesn't work great when we get to routing with react. We'll try and figure out how to do this.

what is the median grade for this class
i think around 3 to 3.5
there's no formal curve
hard to get a 4.0 


---------

All HTML elements must contain a closing tag?

False, for example image tags, link elements 
HTML elements represent a piece of our tree. They are almost always containing some kind of content. But some elements
don't contain any content. Technically image elements are self closing

<img src="" alt="" /> in xml this is how you'd write it, but in modern html we just skip it.

-------------

Two paragraph elements 
<p>foo</p><p>bar</p>

False. They don't occur on the same line
paragraph elements are considered block elements 

Block elements have line breaks after them

HTML like java ignore line space. It doesn't matter where the spaces are

The test suites sometimes don't ignore line breaks so sometimes this can fail.

In general we write them on separate lines just for readability

--------------

a 'head' element

contains meta data information which is not directly displayed

One of the most confusing things
There are a couple elements that are similar

<head> </head>
meata, script tags, it's the head of the document


<header> </header>
this is a body element
it represents the top section of the page, it shows up

<h1> </h1>
this is a heading tag

the header might contain headings


A header would never be inside of the head

--------------------
Which statement is true 

It's possible to do things with CSS instead of using a <h1> heading

Are they equivalent?
Is CSS Better

Chat among yourselves to see if you can come to an agreement

CSS allows you to adjust more. 

But if we are trying to make something a heading, the way to do it is with HTML 
It's simpler, but mostly because for accessiblity reasons
Bots, screen readers, etc... all can leverage when you use HTML because it
has semantic meaning.

You can still use CSS to customize headings if you want and retain the semantic meaning 
that you intended to make this a heading.

A div element is a block element. But otherwise it has no semantic meaning on
its own.

We can use <div> to group things

ex
<div>
	<h1> heading </h1>
	<p> subtitle </p>
<div>

So we can group, and we can also apply styling to the divs to make the box for the div one color and the element
a different color

-------------

***** Go back to the Slides (slide 8)*******************************************

Discuss in pairs
What are three reasons to make sure web sites conform to web standards for accessiblity

More folks can use it
It's the law
Easier to scale (standards)
Different device coverage. Including devices we don't know about yet.
It benefits everyone



--------------------
Slide 9

Universal design
curb cuts for example

They help people besides wheelchairs, bikers, skateboarders, etc

Working w/o a mouse can help people who just broke their arm
Or lost their mouse

It's not hard



Demo of VoiceOver
It reads you the content on your screen
It's for blind people

To open up voiceover
Hit command f5

Customize the reading voice

Did you all get a chance to experience this? We want you to see how 2% to 4% of the population.
It's really hard to navigate with a screen reader. We want to make it easy.

Slide 12 
Poll Question
*** BACK to Poll Questions *************************************************************************

Which techniques are used to support the PERCEIVABILITY of a web page? Select all that apply

All of these things listed are techniques

html - allows us to leverage the semantics that come with HTML. so headings are described as headings
if you use them correctly, you can automatically generate table of contents for example

using <sections> is helpful. it's got a little more meaning than a <div> because sections are parts of a web
page, and divs can be used to just combine

alt - makes it way easier to 

aria-label - another standard for accessiblity support. it's like adding alt tags to things that
aren't images
So anything can have an alt tag, even like a <div>

Particularly if you want to have a div to put in a background image to show an image because you
want to customize with styling, and you still want an alt
----------------

Which of the following approaches are important for creating accessible web pages?



-------------

True or false, you should include a word such as "picture" or "image" so that screenerader knows there is an image?
False - you don't need to add these


All elements need an 'aria-label' attribute to make them accessible?

all, most, or only a few

In general we don't add aria-label to most elements.
Things that are purely visual, then you want to add an aria label. But if there is text associated, then we don't need to add.

<div class="search-image" aria-label="search"></div>

example where you want to have a search image icon on your page and you want to be able to have alt text to describe
but it's not a image.

only use them for visual only elements. They are there for edge cases. Where things wouldn't normally be accessible.


Note that there's a typical web page structure 

--------------

There are accessiblity checkers
Look at the text
WAVE is a good one
Achecker is another

include alt, if you have anything that's just an image, then use aria-label

-------------

Windows uses "narrator"
JAWS was another one
