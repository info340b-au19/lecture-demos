# Lecture Demos

There are demo files for 2 lectures in this repo

The first is the intro to javascript
The second is functional programming

The files appended with "-javascriptLecture" are related to the javascript lecture
The files appended with "-funcprogLecture" are for the functional programming lecture

There's not alot of code in either, particularly the javascript lecture because most of the javascript examples were done in the console. But there still were a couple of things (like using an aria-label on div with background image) that you can see as well as using the sr-only tag.

So basically if you want to see the code in action from the specific class, just copy the 3 correct versions of files to index.html, style.css and index.js from the correct lecture and you'll be good to go.
